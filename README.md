## 1. Preamble

It is a way for a person interested in a subject to subscribe to receive information about the subject of interest.

In this case we capture the name and email of the interested visitor.

On the other hand, who is the promoter of the content/event will be able to notify everyone at once in a simple and quick way, it is a means of mass communication using an API (tool) of email marketink.

Landing page are website pages where leads arrive and know the company or its services. This type of page is intended to draw the attention of "visitors to convert them into leads by obtaining their contact details. This project is a very simple landing page, focusing on converting the visitor interested in lead.

## 2. Project summary

In this project we build a web application, where a technology school (Bit Rocket School) can reach target audiences through the targeted and planned sharing of this capture page. In this way being able to reach more students and retain new customers.

An integration was made via [API](https://mailchimp.com/developer/) of [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) to manage the catches made by the Landing Page and generate the Campaigns according to each need to reach the desired target audience.

## 3. User Story

Prospective students are visitors who are interested in the content propagated through this Landin Page.

Their desires are to know and learn more about new technologies, and to be more and more updated and ready to operate in an increasingly dynamic job market.

Thus, after capturing all the email provided by the visitor through Landin Page, we chose to send a captivating email like the Portfolio of all courses and their respective promotions.

## 4. General considerations

The project was developed in three sprints of one week each, where it was separated into four stories:

- **First Story:**

As a visitor I would like to receive an email with all the information about the courses available and their respective values, the information must be arranged in a simple way.

- **Second Story:**

I would like the page to be simple and objective, as I would not like to be distracted by a visually polluted page.

- **Third Story:**

The alphabetical order would help to search for the courses that I want to know information. The email received (generated by the Mailchimp campaign) being organized in this way will facilitate the search.

- **Fourth Story:**

There are many companies that have great courses, but how to reach a target audience? How to reach more students and future skilled professionals? There are so many information on the network today that users are lost amid so much exposed data. It would be interesting to be able to get in touch with these students to build a communication bridge amid so many canyons of information displayed today in the great WWW sea.
